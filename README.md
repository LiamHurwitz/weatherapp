# weatherapp
A weather app for my buddy so she can look at the weather. 

## Tools it will use:
- WeatherAPI.com for the weather API
- API backend written in Lua because Brazil is numero uno
- Application written in Love2D for practice for future projects. I do not care that it is a game engine anything can be a GUI library if you ask nicely
